ATS Resume Parser (Internship Project)

This project showcases a transformer-based ATS (Applicant Tracking System) resume parser developed during my internship at TalentRecruit Pvt Ltd. The parser is built on the Longformer model, fine-tuned to extract key information from resumes such as contact details, education, and work experience.

This repository contains sample code that highlights the structure of the parser. The final version of the code, which includes proprietary optimizations and integrations, is not publicly accessible.

Key Features:
-Transformer-based resume parsing using Longformer.
-Entity extraction for structured resume data (e.g., name, skills, experience).
-Fine-tuned for handling long, unstructured resume documents.
